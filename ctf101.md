- Forensics
    - Forensics is the art of recovering the digital trail left on a computer. There are plenty of methods to find data which is seemingly deleted, not stored, or worse, covertly recorded. 
    - File Formats
        - File signatures (also known as File Magic Numbers) are bytes within a file used to identify the format of the file. Generally theyâ€™re 2-4 bytes long, found at the beginning of a file.
        - xxd file-a.jpg | head
    - Metadata
        - To find metadata
        - exiftool <file_name>
        - 
        - Timestamps are data that indicate the time of certain events (MAC): - Modification â€“ when a file was modified - Access â€“ when a file or entries were read or accessed - Creation â€“ when files or entries were created.
        - stat <file_name>
        - 
    - Steganography
        - Steganography is the practice of hiding data in plain sight. Steganography is often embedded in images or audio.
        - Hide text inside, you could also hide a second image inside the first.
    - Disk Imaging
        - Checksum
        - Validating files is one of the most important aspects of disk forensics. This hash will change if any part of file is changed, making it great for catching alterations to the original source.
        - sha256sum <file_name>
        - Write Blocker
        - It's common practice to use a write blocker before imagining a disk. This prevents unintended writes to the disk to maintain integrity.
    - Memory Forensics
        - Volatility Basics 
        - A good workflow is as follows:
        - In order to properly use Volatility you must supply a profile with --profile=PROFILE, therefore before any sleuthing, you need to determine the profile using imageinfo:

        - vol.py -f ~/image.raw imageinfo 
        - Dump Processes 
        - vol.py -f ~/image.raw pslist --profile=Win7SP0x64 pstree
        - Process Memory Dump 
        - vol.py -f ~/image.raw --profile=Win7SP0x64 memdump -p 2019 -D dump/
